## 🤝 How We Worked Together  

### 🔹 Open Zoom Workspace  
We maintained a live Zoom session where team members could join and leave as needed, ensuring continuous collaboration. AFK times were communicated to keep expectations clear.  

### 🔹 Regular Check-Ins  
Scheduled full-team meetings helped us align on progress, address challenges, and set next steps.  

### 🔹 Flexible Coding Breakouts  
We worked solo or in pairs, depending on the task, balancing deep focus with peer collaboration.  

### 🔹 Centralized Communication  
To prevent data silos and ensure transparency, we used:  
- **Slack** for process updates and discussions  
- **GitHub** for version control and task tracking
